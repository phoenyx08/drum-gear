I got a 16-inch floor tom, my groove’s running deep,
Rhythms in my soul that won’t let me sleep.
But a silumin holder, it couldn’t take the load,
Now it’s cracked and broken, out on the road.

But every break’s a lesson, every crack a groove,
I’ll find a way to fix it and keep on making moves.

Oh, silumin groove, don’t let me down,
I’ll patch you up and bring the sound.
Every beat, every note, I’ll see it through,
This drummer’s heart beats strong for you.

Grabbed some epoxy, made a quick repair,
Hoping that the rhythm won’t disappear.
The holder may be fragile, but my will is strong,
The music’s in my veins, I’ll carry it along.

Every crack’s a story, every break’s a test,
This floor tom’s singing, and I’m doing my best.

Oh, silumin groove, don’t let me down,
I’ll patch you up and bring the sound.
Every beat, every note, I’ll see it through,
This drummer’s heart beats strong for you.

Steel may bend, and wood may warp,
But my spirit’s like thunder in a rhythmic storm.
From the stage to the streets, I’ll keep it alive,
A broken holder won’t stop my drive.

Oh, silumin groove, don’t let me down,
I’ll patch you up and bring the sound.
Every beat, every note, I’ll see it through,
This drummer’s heart beats strong for you.

So here’s to the grooves, the highs and the lows,
A drummer’s life is the path I chose.
From a silumin break to a roaring song,
The rhythm inside will keep marching on.
