I got a 16-inch floor tom, my groove’s running deep,<br>
Rhythms in my soul that won’t let me sleep.
<br>
But a silumin holder, it couldn’t take the load,
<br>
Now it’s cracked and broken, out on the road.
<br>
<br>
But every break’s a lesson, every crack a groove,
<br>
I’ll find a way to fix it and keep on making moves.
<br>
<br>
Oh, silumin groove, don’t let me down,
<br>
I’ll patch you up and bring the sound.
<br>
Every beat, every note, I’ll see it through,
<br>
This drummer’s heart beats strong for you.
<br>
<br>
Grabbed some epoxy, made a quick repair,
<br>
Hoping that the rhythm won’t disappear.
<br>
The holder may be fragile, but my will is strong,
<br>
The music’s in my veins, I’ll carry it along.
<br>
<br>
Every crack’s a story, every break’s a test,
<br>
This floor tom’s singing, and I’m doing my best.
<br>
<br>
Oh, silumin groove, don’t let me down,
<br>
I’ll patch you up and bring the sound.
<br>
Every beat, every note, I’ll see it through,
<br>
This drummer’s heart beats strong for you.
<br>
<br>
Steel may bend, and wood may warp,
<br>
But my spirit’s like thunder in a rhythmic storm.
<br>
From the stage to the streets, I’ll keep it alive,
<br>
A broken holder won’t stop my drive.
<br>
<br>
Oh, silumin groove, don’t let me down,
<br>
I’ll patch you up and bring the sound.
<br>
Every beat, every note, I’ll see it through,
<br>
This drummer’s heart beats strong for you.
<br>
<br>
So here’s to the grooves, the highs and the lows,
<br>
A drummer’s life is the path I chose.
<br>
From a silumin break to a roaring song,
<br>
The rhythm inside will keep marching on.
